# Information Security Basics Tutorial
"""
This tutorial focuses on key concepts in information security, including authentication mechanisms, encryption techniques, and firewalls.

## Authentication Methods
"""
Authentication ensures that the individual or system requesting access to resources is who they claim to be. There are several common methods of authentication:
- **Password-based authentication**: The user provides a password, which is checked against the system's records.
- **Biometric authentication**: This method uses unique biological traits, such as fingerprints or facial recognition, to verify identity.
- **Two-factor authentication (2FA)**: Combines two different methods of authentication, typically a password and a verification code sent to a trusted device.
These methods are crucial in securing systems and preventing unauthorized access.

## Encryption
"""
Encryption is a process used to protect sensitive data by converting it into an unreadable format, called ciphertext, which can only be deciphered by authorized users with a decryption key.
Two main types of encryption are:
- **Symmetric encryption**: Both the sender and receiver share the same key for encryption and decryption. Examples include AES and DES.
- **Asymmetric encryption**: This method uses two different keysâ€”a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. RSA is a common example.
Encryption is a fundamental tool for ensuring confidentiality and data integrity in information security.
