# AI Basics Tutorial
"""
This tutorial covers essential concepts in artificial intelligence (AI), focusing on supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as how to evaluate the performance of machine learning models.

## Supervised Learning
"""
Supervised learning is one of the most commonly used forms of machine learning. In this method, the model is trained on labeled data, where each input has a corresponding known output. The goal is to make accurate predictions when new, unseen data is provided.
Common applications include classification tasks like spam detection and regression tasks like predicting house prices.
Supervised learning algorithms include:
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forests
- Linear and Logistic Regression

## Model Evaluation
"""
Once a machine learning model is trained, it is important to evaluate its performance. Key metrics used to assess a model's accuracy include:
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly predicted outcomes.
- **Precision**: The ratio of true positive results to all positive results (including false positives).
- **Recall**: The ratio of true positive results to all actual positives (including false negatives).
These metrics help us understand how well a model is performing on the given task.
