# 5. Computer Vision

## - What is Computer Vision?
Computer vision is a branch of AI that enables machines to interpret and understand visual data from the world, similar to human vision. 
It involves tasks such as recognizing objects, detecting patterns, and extracting meaningful insights from images and videos.

## - Key Techniques in Computer Vision
Key techniques in computer vision include:
- Image Classification: Assigning labels to images based on their content, such as "cat" or "car."
- Object Detection: Identifying and locating specific objects within images or videos, crucial for applications like autonomous driving.
- Image Segmentation: Dividing images into segments for detailed analysis, useful in medical imaging to isolate tumors.
- Feature Extraction: Identifying important features like edges or textures for further analysis, such as facial recognition.
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Converting images of text into editable and searchable formats, widely used in digitizing documents.
- 3D Reconstruction: Creating 3D models from 2D images, essential for virtual and augmented reality applications.

## - Applications in Industries
Computer vision impacts various industries:
- Healthcare: Assists in analyzing medical images for early disease detection.
- Autonomous Vehicles: Enables self-driving cars to perceive their environment for safe navigation.
- Security: Utilizes facial recognition and behavior analysis for enhanced surveillance.
- Retail: Monitors inventory and analyzes customer behavior.
- Agriculture: Helps in crop monitoring and health assessment.
- Manufacturing: Automates quality control by inspecting products for defects.

##The ongoing advancements in computer vision technology will continue to drive innovation and efficiency across multiple sectors.
