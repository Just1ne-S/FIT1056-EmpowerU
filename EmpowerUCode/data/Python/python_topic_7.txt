#7. File Handling
#Reading and Writing Files  
Use open() to work with files.  
file = open("example.txt", "w")  
file.write("Hello, file!")  
file.close()

#Working with CSV Files  
The csv module helps read and write CSV files.  
import csv  
with open('data.csv', mode='r') as file:  
    reader = csv.reader(file)  
    for row in reader:  
        print(row)

#Error Handling in File Operations  
Handle errors with try-except.  
try:  
    file = open("nonexistent.txt", "r")  
except FileNotFoundError:  
    print("File not found!")  
Use the with statement to manage file resources efficiently.
