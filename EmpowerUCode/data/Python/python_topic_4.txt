#4. Data Structures
#Lists  
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]  
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple  
Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their items.

#Tuples  
Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable (cannot be changed).  
coordinates = (10, 20)

#Dictionaries  
Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs.  
student = {"name": "Justin", "age": 19}  
print(student["name"])  # Output: Justin

#Sets  
Sets store unique items with no specific order.  
numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4}
