#5. Functions and Modules
Defining and Calling Functions  
Functions are reusable pieces of code.  
def greet(name):  
    print("Hello, " + name)

greet("Justin")

#Lambda Functions  
Lambda functions are short, anonymous functions.  
square = lambda x: x * x  
print(square(5))  # Output: 25

#Importing Modules and Libraries  
Modules are collections of functions.  
import math  
print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0  
Install additional libraries using pip, e.g., pip install numpy.
