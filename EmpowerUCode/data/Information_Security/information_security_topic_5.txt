# 5. Access Control Measures
## - Access Control:
A key element of information security that manages who can view or use resources in a computing environment. Effective access control is vital for protecting sensitive 
information and ensuring that only authorized individuals can access specific resources.

## - Types of Access Control:
- Discretionary Access Control (DAC): 
  In DAC, resource owners decide who can access specific resources. While flexible, it can lead to security risks if not managed well. 
  For example, a file owner might mistakenly grant access to unauthorized users.

- Mandatory Access Control (MAC): 
  MAC enforces security policies across an organization. Access rights are set by a central authority based on security levels (e.g., top secret, public). 
  Users cannot change these rights, making it suitable for government and military applications.

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): 
  In RBAC, access rights are based on user roles within the organization. Users get permissions tied to their job functions, 
  which simplifies management and enhances security by limiting access to necessary information.

## - Authentication Methods:
- Passwords: 
  The most common authentication method, requiring users to provide a secret word or phrase. While simple, weak password management can be a risk. 
  Strong, complex passwords and regular updates are encouraged.

- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): 
  MFA requires multiple verification forms before access is granted. This adds a layer of security beyond passwords. 
  For instance, users may need to enter a password and a one-time code sent to their mobile device.

- Biometrics: 
  This method uses unique biological traits (e.g., fingerprints, facial recognition) for identity verification. 
Biometrics offer high security since biological traits are hard to replicate and are increasingly used for secure access.
