#2. Types of Threats
##- Malware: 
Malware, short for malicious software, refers to various types of software designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems. 
It is a significant threat to both individual users and organizations, leading to data loss, system failures, and financial harm. 
Malware can come in many forms, such as Viruses, Worms, and Trojan Horses, each with its unique methods of attack.
##  - Viruses: 
  These are malicious code fragments that attach themselves to legitimate software or files, spreading when the infected software is executed. 
  Viruses can corrupt or delete files, and their effects can range from minor annoyances to significant data loss. 
  For instance, a virus might corrupt critical system files, leading to operational disruptions.

##  - Worms: 
  Unlike viruses, worms are standalone malware that replicate themselves and spread to other computers without needing to attach to legitimate programs. 
  They often exploit vulnerabilities in operating systems or applications, consuming network bandwidth and causing widespread disruption. 
  An example is the Morris Worm, which infected thousands of computers in the late 1980s, illustrating the potential for rapid spread.

##  - Trojan Horses: 
  These are malicious programs disguised as legitimate software, tricking users into installing them. Once installed, Trojans can steal sensitive information, 
  create backdoors for other malware, or perform other harmful activities without the user's knowledge. A notable example is the Zeus Trojan, 
  which targets banking information and has led to significant financial losses for users and institutions.

##- Phishing: 
Phishing is a deceptive practice used to obtain sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details, by pretending to be a trustworthy entity. 
Phishing attacks can take various forms, including emails, text messages, and fake websites that closely mimic legitimate ones. Awareness and training are essential 
to help users recognize and avoid phishing attempts. Organizations often conduct simulated phishing exercises to educate employees about identifying suspicious emails.

##- Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks: 
A Denial-of-Service attack aims to overwhelm a system, service, or network, rendering it unavailable to legitimate users. Attackers achieve this by flooding the 
target with excessive traffic or exploiting vulnerabilities. Such attacks can cause significant financial losses, disrupt operations, and damage an organization's reputation. 
Variants like Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks involve multiple compromised systems attacking a single target, amplifying the threat. 
For example, during a DDoS attack, a website might experience a sudden surge in traffic that exceeds its bandwidth capacity, leading to downtime and loss of service to users.
