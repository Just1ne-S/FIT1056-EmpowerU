#4. Network Security Fundamentals
##- Firewalls: 
Network security systems that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules. They serve as barriers between trusted internal networks 
and untrusted external networks. Firewalls can be hardware-based or software-based, and they play a crucial role in protecting networks from unauthorized access and attacks. 
For example, an organization might use a firewall to block access to certain ports or protocols that are known to be vulnerable.

##- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): 
Systems that monitor networks or systems for malicious activity or policy violations. IDS can be either host-based (monitoring individual devices) 
or network-based (monitoring entire networks). They analyze traffic patterns and alert administrators to potential threats, enabling rapid response to security incidents. 
Some IDS solutions also include Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), which can automatically take action to block threats in real time.

##- Virtual Private Networks (VPNs): 
Secure connections that encrypt data between a user and a network over the internet. VPNs protect sensitive information when using public 
networks and provide remote access to organizational resources. They work by creating a secure tunnel for data transmission, preventing eavesdropping and data interception. 
For instance, employees working remotely can use a VPN to securely access their company's internal network, ensuring that sensitive data remains protected while in transit.

##- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM): 
Solutions that aggregate and analyze security data from across an organization in real-time. SIEM systems collect log and event data generated by host devices, network equipment,
and security systems, providing a comprehensive view of the organization's security posture. They help in identifying potential security incidents, analyzing threats, and 
responding effectively. Organizations use SIEM tools to comply with regulatory requirements and improve their overall security incident response capabilities.

##- Network Segmentation: 
The practice of dividing a network into smaller, distinct segments to enhance security and performance. By isolating sensitive data and critical systems, organizations 
can reduce the attack surface and limit the spread of malware in case of a breach. For example, a company might segment its financial data from other departments, 
ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive financial information.
